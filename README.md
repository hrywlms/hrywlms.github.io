# Personal Site
This is my personal site purposefully created for trying out new tools, layouts, and frameworks (of which there is a never-ending supply). I update it pretty regularly and probably break it pretty regularly too. It can be found at [hrywlms.co.uk](http://hrywlms.co.uk/).

### Thanks
Thank you to those creating and working on the amazing tools ([CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), etc...) people like myself get to build things with every day.
