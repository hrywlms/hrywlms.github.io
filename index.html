				<h1>
					Hello
				</h1>

				<p>I'm Harry and I was born in France. I live in the beautiful county of Shropshire in the UK. I'm an advocate for usability across all screen sizes and devices. The web is a beautiful and vital tool today, I'd like to have my part in making it a better and more productive place - with mobile performance as a paramount concern, after security.</p>

				<p>When I'm not figuring out what's next you can probably find me running, indoor climbing or watching the Super GT.</p>

				<h2>
					What?
				</h2>

				<p>First make it, then make it work, then make it work better. This is what I think everyone who develops anything should use as the basis of their project. If something is broken, try breaking it a bit more and see what you find.</p>

				<h2>
					This site
				</h2>

				<p>The source for this site is available to view and fork <a href="https://github.com/hrywlms/hrywlms.github.io">on GitHub</a>. Why not try cloning it from your terminal?</p>

<!-- Whitespace is preserved in the <pre> tag, so unindented ugliness -->

</code>
</pre>

				<p>It's a fairly simple site - clear, responsive and that's the way I like it. I can implement, test, and break new things on a live site without much worry. Eventually I will utilise <a title="Jekyll is a simple static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favourite web server." href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to publish a few articles on relevant topics of interest. I think everyone should write occasionally on things that they are passionate about.</p>
